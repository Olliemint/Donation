                        We have noticed that in our society, there are so many cases of children who are bright, focused and have big dreams,
                        but most of these dreams end up being abandoned simply because these children come from struggling families. Unless
                        their stories are aired on tv’s, it’s almost impossible to know if they even exists or if their stories are actually
                        true.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For a fact we know that there are so many well wishers out there who are willing to offer support to these children but
                        knowing who they are or how to reach to them and support them is difficult or even impossible, unless the media airs
                        their stories. So it is for this reason that we thought of creating a web application to ensure not only the NGO’S but
                        also individual well wishers get an opportunity to create an impact to these children’s lives and ensure they get to
                        live up to their full potential in life.
